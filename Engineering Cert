Engineering Cert

- For vehicles not released in Australia, an Engineering Certificate (VASS Approval Certificate) is required. (VASS is for VIC only, there are equivilants for other states)
- Eng Cert is required BEFORE RWC
  - Most mechanics will refuse/not want to work on a vehicle if no eng cert. They're usually uncertain if anything they do will affect eng cert
  - Vehicle must comply with ADR of year of vehicle's manufacture
 
 
 
 

List of works required for Eng Cert:
 -  Seatbelts
    - Front seatbelts need to be re-webbed to ADR standards
        - Seatbelt King in Bayside will do this
            - Recommended by Engineer and Mechanic
            - Cost was approx $80 per belt (as of 2020)
    - Rear seatbealts are trickier
      **** DOES NOT APPLY TO PHASE III (1992 - 1995 aleady have 3 point seatbelts in back seats) ****
        - Rear seatbelts are required to be 3-point seatbelts
            - Extensive work needs to be done to install
                - Bracket needs to be installed under side panels in boot
                - Bracket needs to conform to specific designs provided by engineer
                - Brackets need to be custom fabricated to engineer designs
                - Side panels need to be cut to allow for seatbelt to enter cabin area
        - ALTERNATIVELY
            - Rear seats can be removed
            - Rear area can then be classified as cargo area
            - Vehicle can then be registered as 2-seater vehicle
            - After registration, rear seats and original seatbelts can be re-installed
            **** WARNING ****
                - If this is done, "technically" the car does require another VASS Eng Cert to state it still meets ADR requirements
                - You don't really have to do this.. it can be one of those things you just dont register
                    - IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS
                        - Insurance will ask how many seats in the car
                        - If you removed the seats and put them back in after rego, it will be registered as a 2 seater car
                        - Insurance will allow a policy to be taken out if you tell them it's a 2 seater, but unlikely to cover you if something actually happens
                        - If you say 2 seater, they will see 4 seats and refuse to pay for repairs
                        - If you say 4 seater, they will see the car is registered as a 2 seater and consider the rear seats as illegal mod, and refuse to cover repairs
                        **** DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK ****
