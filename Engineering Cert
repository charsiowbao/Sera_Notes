            **** WARNING ****
                - If this is done, "technically" the car does require another VASS Eng Cert to state it still meets ADR requirements
                - You don't really have to do this.. it can be one of those things you just dont register
                    - IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS
                        - Insurance will ask how many seats in the car
                        - If you removed the seats and put them back in after rego, it will be registered as a 2 seater car
                        - Insurance will allow a policy to be taken out if you tell them it's a 2 seater, but unlikely to cover you if something actually happens
                        - If you say 2 seater, they will see 4 seats and refuse to pay for repairs
                        - If you say 4 seater, they will see the car is registered as a 2 seater and consider the rear seats as illegal mod, and refuse to cover repairs
                        **** DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK ****
